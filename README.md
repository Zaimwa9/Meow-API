# Meow-Newsletter

This was my first attempt to set live a webserver in Node.js using express, MongoDB (mongoose) and template rendering.
The app scraps random.cat/meow on each request to display a random cat picture.
A user model is ready to, in the future, turn it into a newsletter.

### Configure your MongoDB credentials
1) Add a ~/config/config.json and ~/config/index.js to store your connection credentials;
2) Require the config.json in app

### Deploy live
